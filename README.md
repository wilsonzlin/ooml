# [ooml](https://ooml.org)
Polyglot web UI framework. Fast, easy to use, advanced, lightweight, and compatible with IE 9.

## Features

### Incredibly simple
- Based on JSON and basic object orientation.
- No dependencies or toolchain/environment requirements.
- No special language required, and usage is designed around basic objects and arrays.
- Gradual learning curve&mdash;create large, scalable apps with just a few concepts.

### Have it your way
- Integrated with a global store, message broker, and event system.
- Abstract classes, type hinting, change listeners&mdash;all are available, and more.
- Write in HTML, [JS, JSX, Python, Java, or Ruby, with more to come](https://github.com/ooml/oomlvm).
- Develop apps at light speed with [ooml-sync](https://github.com/ooml/ooml-sync).

### Very fast
- No virtual DOM; asynchronous DOM updates.
- [Very fast with low memory usage](https://ooml.org/performance/), even in IE 9.
- Asynchronously load a 12 KB gzipped [ooml.js](https://ooml.org/ooml.js) compressed, CDN delivered, and highly cacheable.
- Optionally compile to bytecode:
  - Get bonus static checks and optimisations.
  - Load a 5 KB [VM-only ooml.js](https://github.com/ooml/oomlvm) and compressed bytecode.
  - Remove runtime parsing, type checking, and assertions for faster performance.

### Ready for reuse
- Almost every existing JS library out there is already compatible.
- Easily share modules by precompiling them and hosting the single bytecode file anywhere.
  - Naturally decentralised, cacheable, and compressable.
- Split bytecode into namespaces or classes to allow granular, frugal loading.

### High safety
- Type hinting and strict syntax helps reduce and prevent bugs.
- Large amounts of code dedicated to checking and validating.
- Use of `undefined` and assigning to non-existent properties are prevented.
