# oomlc-python

Compile Python to ooml bytecode.

## Under construction

oomlc-python is made available in a preliminary form. Things might not work as expected, break randomly, or change dramatically until the first beta milestone. 

## Getting started

## Considerations

oomlc-python, while reasonably comprehensive, does not work with 100% of Python's features and syntax. Always refer to the [documentation](https://ooml.org/docs/oomlc-python) for the authoritative source of what works and what doesn't.

## Performance

Currently, ooml does not understand type notations, and delegates everything to the runtime, resulting in less-than-stellar performance.
