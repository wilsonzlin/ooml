# Versioning here vs. in specific language compiler

## Pros

- Take advantage of full language features per language.
  - If per language, then this would have to generate the safest format for all languages.
- Ensure API is synchronised across all platforms.
  - Important for sharing modules with different source languages.
  
## Cons

- Changes in specific language(s) creates entire new version.
