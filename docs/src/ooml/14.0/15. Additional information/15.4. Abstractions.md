One of the reasons ooml is very powerful and useful is because of the level of abstraction it provides. For example, it removes the need to manually traverse and manipulate the DOM, and synchronising the state with the view. However, like any other abstraction, it's not [leak-proof](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/).
