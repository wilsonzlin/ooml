Type declarations are used for 4 reasons:

- To provide static analysis and type checking, allowing far greater optimisations when compiling.
- To allow code to be better used and transpiled between different languages, espcially when involving statically typed languages.
- To determine appropriate substitution methods in views.
- To allow for optional runtime type checking.
